# Nexus AGI System v3.0

A comprehensive Artificial General Intelligence system featuring quantum simulation, neural-symbolic integration, and advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Overview

This repository contains two complementary AI systems:

1. **Nexus Core (Python)** - A meta-intelligent system that generates AGI-capable algorithms
2. **ARIA (JavaScript)** - Adaptive Reasoning Intelligence Architecture with quantum-enhanced processing

Both systems can run as **continuous services** with automatic problem solving and query processing. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for service deployment options.

## Features

### Nexus Core (nexus_agi.py)

- **Quantum Simulation**: OpenQuantumSimulator using Pennylane for quantum computing effects
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: SymbolicReasoner with Prolog integration for logic programming
- **Neural Processing**: Deep learning with PyTorch and transformer embeddings
- **Neuro-Axiomatic Fusion Engine (NAFE)**: Bidirectional translation between neural patterns and logical axioms
- **Self-Synthesizing Architecture Templates (SSAT)**: Evolutionary architecture optimization
- **HoloConcept Engine (HCE)**: Multi-scale holographic concept representations
- **Conscientia-Lattice**: Multi-dimensional ethical reasoning system
- **InfiniteMeta Loop (IML)**: Recursive self-improvement across meta-levels

### ARIA (aria.js)

- **Quantum Neural Network**: Million-qubit processing with superposition and entanglement
- **Multiversal Bridge**: Parallel universe simulation for decision exploration
- **Temporal Paradox Resolver**: Causality violation detection and resolution
- **Consciousness Simulator**: Multi-level awareness and self-reflection modeling

## Installation

### Python (Nexus Core)

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

#### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DOUGLASDAVIS08161978/nexus_agi.git
cd nexus_agi
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Some optional dependencies require additional system setup:
- **PySwip**: Requires SWI-Prolog to be installed on your system
- **Pennylane**: For quantum simulation features
- **torch-geometric**: May require additional configuration

#### Basic Installation (Core features only)
```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas torch transformers scikit-learn networkx sympy joblib matplotlib
```

### JavaScript (ARIA)

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.0 or higher

#### Setup

1. Navigate to the repository directory (if not already there):
```bash
cd nexus_agi
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies (if any are added in the future):
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Running Nexus Core (Python)

Basic execution with climate crisis demonstration:
```bash
python3 nexus_agi.py
```

**Run as a continuous service:**
```bash
# Process problems every 5 minutes (default)
python3 nexus_service.py

# Custom interval (e.g., every 60 seconds)
python3 nexus_service.py --interval 60
```

The default demonstration will:
1. Initialize all subsystems (Quantum, Symbolic, Neural, etc.)
2. Define a complex global problem (climate crisis)
3. Generate specialized algorithms for subproblems
4. Compose them into a unified solution
5. Perform ethical validation
6. Display comprehensive results

#### Example Output:
```
[QUANTUM] Successfully initialized 8-qubit quantum simulator
[SYMBOLIC] Successfully initialized symbolic reasoner with Prolog
[NEURAL] Successfully initialized neural processor with transformer embeddings
[NAFE] Generating axioms from 5 contextual elements
[NAFE] Generating neural patterns from 5 data points
[NAFE] Performing neuro-axiomatic fusion
[NAFE] Fusion model trained. Final loss: 0.0234f
Fusion Results: {comprehensive output with symbolic axioms, neural patterns, quantum enhancement}

================================================================================
SOLUTION SUMMARY
================================================================================
Problem: Global Climate Crisis Mitigation
Approach: meta-algorithmic composition
... (detailed results)
```

### Running ARIA (JavaScript)

```bash
node aria.js
```

**Run as a continuous service:**
```bash
# Process queries every 5 minutes (default)
node aria_service.js

# Custom interval (e.g., every 120 seconds)
node aria_service.js --interval 120
```

The demonstration will:
1. Initialize quantum neural network with 1M qubits
2. Establish multiversal bridge
3. Initialize temporal paradox resolver
4. Create consciousness simulator
5. Process sample queries
6. Display system status and metrics

#### Example Output:
```

## Service Deployment

Both systems can run as **continuous services** that process problems/queries in an endless loop:

- **Direct execution**: Run service scripts with Python/Node.js
- **Docker**: Deploy as containers using Docker Compose
- **Systemd**: Deploy as Linux system services

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Python service (processes problems every 5 minutes)
python3 nexus_service.py --interval 300

# JavaScript service (processes queries every 5 minutes)
node aria_service.js --interval 300

# Or use Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment guide including:
- Configuration options
- Docker deployment
- Systemd service setup
- Monitoring and logging
- Production recommendations

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    core = MetaAlgorithm_NexusCore()
    
    # Define your problem
    my_problem = {
        "title": "Your Problem Title",
        "type": "complex_adaptive_system",
        "domain_knowledge": {
            "domain1": "Description of domain 1",
            "domain2": "Description of domain 2"
        },
        "stakeholders": ["stakeholder1", "stakeholder2"]
    }
    
    # Define constraints
    constraints = {
        "equity": 0.8,
        "implementation_cost": 0.5,
        "time_horizon": 20
    }
    
    # Generate solution
    solution = core.solve_complex_problem(my_problem, constraints)
    print(solution)
```

### JavaScript Customization

```javascript
const aria = new ARIASystem();

// Process custom query
const response = aria.processQuery("Your question here");
console.log(response);

// Access individual components
const quantumResult = aria.quantumNN.processThought([0.5, 0.3, 0.8]);
const multiverseAnalysis = aria.multiversalBridge.bridgeToParallelUniverse(
    { stateVector: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] },
    { name: "Decision Point" }
);
```

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
1. Code follows existing style conventions
2. New features include documentation
3. Complex algorithms include explanatory comments
4. Ethical considerations are addressed

## Ethical Considerations

Both systems include ethical safeguards:

- **Nexus Core**: ConscientiaLattice evaluates decisions across multiple ethical frameworks
- **ARIA**: Consciousness simulator enables perspective-taking and value alignment

When using these systems:
1. Consider impacts on all stakeholders
2. Test on diverse scenarios
3. Monitor for unintended consequences
4. Provide mechanisms for oversight and feedback

## Performance Notes

### Resource Requirements

**Nexus Core (Python)**:
- Minimum: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 8 CPU cores
- Optimal: 32GB+ RAM, GPU with CUDA support

**ARIA (JavaScript)**:
- Minimum: 2GB RAM
- Recommended: 4GB RAM
- Note: Quantum simulation is classical and memory-limited

### Optimization Tips

1. **Python**: Use GPU acceleration for neural components
2. **JavaScript**: Run with Node.js v16+ for optimal performance
3. **Both**: Start with smaller problem sizes for testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Python: "Module not found" errors**
- Solution: Install missing packages with `pip install <package_name>`
- Check requirements.txt for complete list

**Python: Pennylane/PySwip not available**
- Solution: These are optional. System uses fallback implementations
- For Pennylane: `pip install pennylane`
- For PySwip: Install SWI-Prolog first, then `pip install pyswip`

**JavaScript: Out of memory errors**
- Solution: Reduce numQubits parameter in QuantumNeuralNetwork constructor
- Use Node.js with increased heap: `node --max-old-space-size=4096 aria.js`
